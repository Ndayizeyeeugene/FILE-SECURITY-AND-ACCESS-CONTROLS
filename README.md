          PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a PL/SQL-based File Management System that manages members, files, and a complete audit logging process. It uses database tables, PL/SQL packages, and triggers to enforce business rules, automatically track file operations, and generate a detailed audit trail for every user action. The system ensures security, transparency, and accountability through structured logging and role-based rules.


                PROBLEM STATEMENT

Organizations often need a secure and transparent way to track user activities on digital files. Without proper logging, unauthorized access or file misuse can go unnoticed.
This project solves this problem by implementing an automated audit logging mechanism that records every action performed on files, ensuring accountability and supporting compliance requirements.

             KEY OBJECTIVES

Create and manage system members with defined roles (ADMIN / USER).
Allow users to add and manage files with visibility controls (PUBLIC / PRIVATE).
Automatically log all file-related actions using a dedicated audit log table.
Prevent deletion of ADMIN members to maintain system integrity.
Provide PL/SQL functions to retrieve user roles, file visibility, and ownership counts.
Generate audit reports using analytical SQL queries.
